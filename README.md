# Numbat - Backend

Deployed site: https://numbat17a.herokuapp.com/

About
---
Numbat is an e-invoicing solution that allows businesses to creating, storing and exchange e-invoices cross company in real time.

According to the Australian Taxation Office, a standard paper and PDF invoices costs between $27 and $30 to process while e-invoicing enables process-automation and reduces costs to less than $10 per invoice. With the massive adoption of e-invoice in Australia and New Zealand, our team decided to start a platform that can create Australian standard e-invoice (Peppol) and store them in a secured database with the ability to conveniently exchange them with client and partner businesses. 

Infrastructure
---
- Backend Framework: Python (Flask), PostgresSQL
- Frontend Framework: ReactJS
- Deployment: Heroku
- APIs: We implemented e-invoice creating and rendering feature (converting e-invoice from raw xml format to human readable pdf format) through using APIs built by other teams in the course that we have public access to.

(p.s. The user interface is not completely achieved due to extraordinary circumstances, but we look forward to update this in the future)

This application is created for SENG2021 (Software Engineering Workshop) project by myself, Mathew, Peter and Surya. I primarily worked on the backend with another member from the team. I also designed the User Interface on Figma.
